The dataset have been collected and modified from the following sources, thanks to them:

- LDBC flat files from [LDBC benchmark](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_snb_implementations). Note that the files are not immediately available anymore but they are supposed to be generated with [Datagen](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_snb_datagen)
- Patent dataset from [Unibench](https://github.com/HY-UDBMS/UniBench)
